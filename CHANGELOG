Version 1.0.1   2 Sep 2017
==========================
* timestamp/s was converting the day to "Sat Sep 02 01:02:03 UTC 2017".  Amazon doesn't like the leading zero on the day.
* renamed hex-hash to hash-hex-string, since every place hex-hash was used, it took a hex string as input, computed the
  hash, which was then converted to an integer.
* renamed sha256/hs as sha256/hs64 and return ensure the resulting string is at least 64 characters, padded with leading
  '0's.

Version 1.0.0, 24 Aug 2017
