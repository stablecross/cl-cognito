Version 1.2.0 12 September 2017 
===============================
* cleaned up the version 1.0.1 change notes
* added a note on the return value PasswordResetRequiredException
* added the :new-password keyword parameter to authenticate-user
* authenticate-user will update the password if Cognito requires the password
  to be changed and :new-password is non-nil.

Version 1.0.1  2 Sep 2017
=========================
* timestamp/s was converting the day to "Sat Sep 02 01:02:03 UTC 2017".  Amazon doesn't like the leading zero on the day.
* renamed hex-hash to hash-hex-string, since every place hex-hash was used, it took a hex string as input and computed
  the hash which was then everywhere converted to an integer.
* renamed sha256/hs as sha256/hs64 and ensured the resulting string was at least 64 characters, padded with leading '0's.

Version 1.0.0, 24 Aug 2017
