* timestamp/s was converting the day to "Sat Sep 02 01:02:03 UTC 2017".  Amazon doesn't like the leading zero on the day.
* renamed hex-hash to hash-hex-string, since every place hex-hash was used, it took a hex string as input and computed
  the hash which was then everywhere converted to an integer.
* renamed sha256/hs as sha256/hs64 and ensured the resulting string was at least 64 characters, padded with leading '0's.
